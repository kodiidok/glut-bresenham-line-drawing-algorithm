# DDA and Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithms Visualization

This C++ program utilizes OpenGL to visualize the DDA and Bresenham line drawing algorithms. The user can input coordinates to draw a line using the Bresenham algorithm. The program displays both the DDA and Bresenham-drawn lines along with a grid and Cartesian coordinates.

## Features
- **Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm:** User-input coordinates are drawn using the Bresenham algorithm.
- **Visualization:** Lines are drawn on an OpenGL window with additional features like grid and Cartesian coordinates

## Instructions:
1. Run the program.
2. Enter coordinates for the line using the Bresenham algorithm.
3. The DDA-drawn line and the Bresenham-drawn line will be displayed.

**Note:** Enter coordinates from -10 to +10 for accurate visualization.

## Dependencies:
- OpenGL and GLUT libraries.
